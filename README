README for abby
---------------

abby is a front-end (or a graphical user interface) for cclive
and clive that can be used to download videos from Youtube and
similar video hosting services.

For a complete list of the supported hosts, please refer to the
documentation of c/clive utilities.

abby is written in C++ and depends on the Qt framework.


Using abby
----------

* abby requires a path to either clive(1) or cclive(1) command.
This can be defined in the program preferences. abby will also
prompt for the path if it is undefined.

* Scan feature currently only supports Youtube video links,
both regular and embedded. It can be used to scan *any* URL
(or web page) for video links -- e.g. Youtube playlists.
