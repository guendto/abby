Using abby
----------

* abby requires path to either clive(1) or cclive(1) command

  This is defined in the program preferences (Edit / Preferences).


* abby can parse RSS feeds for video links

  The links can be tranferred to the download list after this.


* abby can scan for video links from any web source

  The scan feature currently supports only Youtube links ("regular"
  and embedded). It can be used to scan Youtube playlists, for example.

-------------

- Qt 4.4+

  Make sure that the Qt development files can be found
  if you are trying to build abby from the source code.
