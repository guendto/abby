README for abby
---------------

abby is a front-end for cclive and clive video extraction utilities. It is
written in C++ and depends on the Qt framework.

abby was originally intended for cclive but additional support for
clive was added later in the 0.2.0 release.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Qt 4.4+, if you are building abby from the source code, be sure
to install the development files
  
Either:
- cclive 0.4.3+, from http://code.google.com/p/cclive/
Or:
- clive 2.1.14+, from http://code.google.com/p/clive/


Building abby
-------------

Normally:
  qmake-qt4 "QT+=network xml" && make

Installation is not currently supported but you may just as well copy
the 'abby' executable to your ~/bin directory, for example.
