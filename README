README for abby
---------------

abby is a front-end for cclive and clive video extraction utilities. It is
written in C++ and depends on the Qt framework.

abby was originally intended for cclive but additional support for
clive was added later in the 0.2.0 release.


Using abby as a front-end
-------------------------

* abby requires a path to either clive(1) or cclive(1) command.
This can be defined in the program preferences. abby will also
prompt for the path if it is undefined.

* The RSS feed parsing feature which was added in abby 0.3.0
is intended to replace the clivefeed utility in the clive-utils
project.

* The video scan feature (or "scan feature") which was added
in abby 0.4.0 is intended to replace the clivescan utility
in the clive-utils project. The scan feature can be used
to scan *any* web page for video links.

  1. Scan currently detects Youtube videos only

     * It is uncertain if the support will be expanded
       to cover other hosts

     * If there is need for additional support, please
       contact the author

  2. Video links can be either "regular" or embedded ones

  3. Little known facts:

     * clive previously supported --scan option in 0.1.x - 1.x

     * the feature was removed in clive 2.x and re-implemented
       as `clivescan' utility as part of the clive-utils project

     * abby's scan feature is now the third iteration of the same
       scan feature that originated in clive 0.1.x

     * the scan feature has been able to scan videos from Youtube
       playlists as early as in clive 0.1.x
