Using abby
----------

* abby requires path to either clive(1) or cclive(1) command
  This is defined in the program preferences (Edit / Preferences).


* abby can parse RSS feeds for video links
  The links can be tranferred to the download list after this.


* abby can scan for video links from any web source
  The scan feature currently supports only Youtube links ("regular"
  and embedded). It can be used to scan Youtube playlists, for example.

* If you are an avid user of Youtube RSS feeds, see here:
    http://www.youtube.com/rssls

  And note that the previously supported:
    http://youtube.com/rss/user/(username)/videos.rss

  No longer work with abby, due to some HTTP redirecting voodoo Google
  has decided to use. Instead use:
    http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/base/users/(username)/uploads?alt=rss

  You may also want to append "&orderby=updated" to the URL.
