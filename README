abby is a front-end for cclive video extraction utility. It is
written in C++ and depends on the Qt 4.3+ framework.


                Prerequisites

- Qt 4.3+, if you are building abby from the source code, be sure
to install the development files also.
  
- cclive 0.2.3+, from http://code.google.com/p/cclive/


                Compiling abby

Normally you can just do:
  % qmake-qt4 && make

This builds the 'abby' executable. Installing isn't currently supported
but you can just as well copy the executable to your ~/bin directory.
