README for abby
---------------

abby is a front-end (or a graphical user interface) for cclive
and clive that can be used to download videos from Youtube and
similar video hosting services.

For a complete list of the supported hosts, please refer to the
documentation of c/clive utilities.

abby is written in C++ and depends on the Qt framework.

abby originally could only be used as a front-end for cclive
but this changed in release 0.2.0 when the support for clive
was added to the application.

As of 0.3.0 the project has started to merge the clive-utils
features into abby. As a result of this, abby can now be used
to parse RSS feeds and scan URLs for video links. Please note
that the scan feature currently only supports Youtube videos.


Using abby
----------

* abby requires a path to either clive(1) or cclive(1) command.
This can be defined in the program preferences. abby will also
prompt for the path if it is undefined.

* Scan feature currently only supports Youtube video links,
both regular and embedded. It can be used to scan *any* URL
(or web page) for video links -- e.g. Youtube playlists.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Qt 4.4+, if you are building abby from the source code, be sure
to install the development files
  
Either:
- cclive 0.4.4+, from http://code.google.com/p/cclive/
Or:
- clive 2.2.1+, from http://code.google.com/p/clive/


Building abby
