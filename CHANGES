Version 0.3.0
(June 21, 2009)

FOREWORD

It is now also possible to download multiple videos on one go.
This was previously limited by design.

We are in the process of merging clive-utils into abby. RSS feed
parsing (clivefeed) has already been implemented. Video link scan
(clivescan) should be implemented in abby by 0.4.0.

  User-visible changes:
   * Add: --format=best support
   * Add: RSS parsing (obsoletes clivefeed in clive-utils)
   * Add: Keyboard shortcuts (e.g. add link, start download)
   * Fix: Tab orders (e.g. main window: paste button)
   * Change: Multi-link support
   * Change: Video format selection
     1. Format dialog for hosts that support multiple video formats
     2. All other hosts default to "flv"
   * Change: More responsive UI when closing Preferences while using clive
     1. invoke (c)clive after closing the preferences only if path was changed
   * Change: Reflect --format ID changes to match recent (c)clive additions
   * Remove: Youtube login support
     1. Until fixed in (c)clive
   * Remove: Finnish translation
     1. Reintroduce translations when we are "stable"
   * Remove: Continue partially downloaded file [box]
     1. Default to use --continue with all transfers
     2. Recent changes to Youtube and Google services allow flvs to be cont'd

  Developer-visible changes:
   * Change: cclive prerequisite -> 0.4.4
   * Change: clive prerequisite -> 2.2.1
   * Change: use --format for both (c)clive (reflect cclive changes)
     1. cclive previously used --download=format
