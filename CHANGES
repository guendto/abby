0.3.0

FOREWORD

This release is a step closer to merge the clive-utils programs
into abby as RSS feed parsing (clivefeed) and link scanning
(clivescan). Note that link scanning is not implemented yet.

It is now also possible to download multiple videos on one go.

  User-visible changes:
   * Add: --format=best support
   * Add: RSS parsing (obsoletes clivefeed in clive-utils)
   * Fix: Tab order (main window: paste button)
   * Change: users may now enter multiple video page links instead of only one
   * Change: --format IDs to reflect (c)clive changes
   * Remove: mp4 support (Google) [broken in cclive 0.4.3]
   * Remove: Youtube login support [at least until it gets fixed in (c)clive]
   * Remove: Continue partially downloaded file [box]
     1. This is now default behaviour
     2. It is now possible to resume Youtube/Google (flv) videos

  Developer-visible changes:
   * Update: cclive prerequisite -> 0.4.3
   * Update: clive prerequisite -> 2.1.14
   * Change: use --format for both (c)clive (reflect cclive changes)
