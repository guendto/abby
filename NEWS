Version 0.4.7
-------------

Scan and RSS overhaul adds progressbar, log view and abort
functionality. Scan patterns have also fixed. RSS overhaul
includes adding support for multiple feeds.

Minimize to system tray. Double-click restores. Right-click
opens the context menu. Added "Minimize to system tray"
checkbox to the program preferences dialog.

Links can now be dropped to the main window, rss dialog
and scan dialog.


Version 0.4.5
--------------

This release addresses c/clive detection and makes minor
enhancements to the preferences dialog allowing immediate
c/clive path verification. Users previously had to specify
the path to the c/clive command, close the dialog and then
open the about dialog to check if the path was valid.

As of this release, abby will attempt to autodetect the
c/clive command from the path if the field is empty in
the preferences.

For example:
  PATH=$PATH:/my/bin/dir ./abby

If the detection fails, abby prompts the user to specify the
path manually.
