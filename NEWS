Version 0.4.8
-------------

Replaced buggy RSS feed parser. Feeds should be parsed properly now.


Version 0.4.7
-------------

Scan and RSS overhaul adds progressbar, log view and abort
functionality. Scan patterns have also fixed. RSS overhaul
includes adding support for multiple feeds.

Minimize to system tray. Double-click restores. Right-click
opens the context menu. Added "Minimize to system tray"
checkbox to the program preferences dialog.

w32 users: Minimize to system tray does not hide abby
from the taskbar. This is a known bug.

Links can now be dropped to the main window, rss dialog
and scan dialog.


Version 0.4.5
--------------

This release addresses c/clive detection and makes minor
enhancements to the preferences dialog allowing immediate
c/clive path verification. Users previously had to specify
the path to the c/clive command, close the dialog and then
open the about dialog to check if the path was valid.

As of this release, abby will attempt to autodetect the
c/clive command from the path if the field is empty in
the preferences.

For example:
  PATH=$PATH:/my/bin/dir ./abby

If the detection fails, abby prompts the user to specify the
path manually.
