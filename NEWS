Version 0.4.5
--------------

This release addresses c/clive detection and adds a button to
verify the path to the command. Previously the user had to first
specify the path to the command in the preferences, close the
window and then open the about window.

As of this release, abby will attempt to autodetect the
c/clive command from the path. For example:
  PATH=$PATH:/my/bin/dir ./abby

If the detection fails, abby prompts the user to specify the
path manually. Note that the detection only occurs if the
path is empty (in the preferences). This feature was added 
to help the new users to get started with abby.
