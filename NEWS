Version 0.4.7
-------------

Scan overhaul adds progressbar, log view and abort functionality.
Scan patterns were also fixed.


Version 0.4.5
--------------

This release addresses c/clive detection and makes minor
enhancements to the preferences dialog allowing immediate
c/clive path verification. Users previously had to specify
the path to the c/clive command, close the dialog and then
open the about dialog to check if the path was valid.

As of this release, abby will attempt to autodetect the
c/clive command from the path if the field is empty in
the preferences.

For example:
  PATH=$PATH:/my/bin/dir ./abby

If the detection fails, abby prompts the user to specify the
path manually.
