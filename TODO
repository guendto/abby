Postponed: volunteers needed
----------------------------

This section lists items that will be postponed until a volunteer
stands up to assist.

* w32: minimize to tray does not hide abby from taskbar
  - No idea how to fix this

* proper application icon to replace the current "TODO" icon
  - 32x32 or higher (24bit preferably)
  - There is a reason I'm a programmer
