* implement link scanning (scandlg.*)
* verify added links against --host output
* implement proxy (rss and scan)
* multi-link system
  - video format combo contents must be generated differently
  - one possible workaround is to check if all links are of the same host
    - if yes, then provide a list of host specific formats
    - otherwise, show flv only
* remove existing translations
  - keep support at code level

Please Santa, bring us...
  * a proper application icon to replace the current "TODO" icon
    - 32x32 or higher (24bit preferably)
